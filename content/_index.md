# Welcome to the FFLegacy Docs!

Welcome to the docs for the Fantasy Football Legacy League (FFLegacy). Here you can
find the rules for the league and other useful tools to help you build and coach
a winning team this season.

## Yahoo

We are using Yahoo to manage our league. You can find our league at the
following URL: https://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/league/fflegacy

While Yahoo already has details on many of the rules in this rulebook, we keep a
copy here written in plain English so everyone has a firm understanding of
what's going on.
