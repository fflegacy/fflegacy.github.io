title = 'Draft Order'
+++

The 2014 draft was a snake draft with the order determined randomly by Yahoo.

## Subsequent Drafts

The teams that do not make the playoffs in the previous year will be positioned
based on how well they perform in the consolation bracket. After they are
placed, the remainder are placed in reverse order of their performance in 
the playoffs.

## Keepers

For picks that have been "occupied" by keepers, the keeper will automatically be
selected and the round will continue. See the [keepers page](/pages/league-format/keepers) 
for more details.
