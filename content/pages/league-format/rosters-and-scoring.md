### Specifics

We have fractional points.
> All players receive fractional points for every yard gained. So if your league awards one point for every 20 rushing yards, you would receive 1/20 of a point for each yard gained.

We have negative points.
> All players receive negative points for every yard lost. So if your league awards one point for every 10 rushing yards, you would lose one fantasy point for every 10 yards lost.
